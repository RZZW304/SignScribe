## Technical Improvements

### Data Persistence
- Multiple storage formats optimized for use case:
  - Properties for templates (human-readable)
  - NBT for session data (game-native)
  - ZIP for exports (bundling)
  - Plain text for history (append-only)

### Performance
- Cached file metadata in TxthFileFilter
- Batch operations reduce I/O overhead
- Stream-based filtering and sorting
- Buffered I/O for large operations
- Lazy loading for templates

### Code Architecture
- Manager classes for each subsystem
- Singleton pattern for global access
- Consistent error handling
- Comprehensive data structures
- Easy to extend with new features

## Statistics Tracking

### Now Tracked
- Total .txth files
- Total file size
- Number of templates saved
- Number of session templates saved
- Total sessions started
- Total signs placed
- Total time spent (milliseconds)
- Most used files
- Most used templates
- Longest sessions
- Average session duration
- Average signs per session

## Usage

### Using Templates
```
1. Save a template:
   - SignScribeTemplateManager.saveTemplate(template)
   - Stored in config/signscribe/templates/

2. Use a template:
   - SignTemplate template = getTemplateByName("shop")
   - template.markAsUsed() (tracks usage)
   - template.toSignPage(1) (converts to SignPage)

3. View popular templates:
   - getMostUsedTemplates(10)
   - getRecentlyUsedTemplates(10)
```

### Batch Operations
```
1. Batch rename:
   - batchRenameFiles(oldNames, newNames)
   - Returns success/failure/skipped lists

2. Batch apply template:
   - batchApplyTemplate("template", targetFiles)
   - Replaces all lines with template text

3. Batch validate:
   - batchValidateFiles(filenames)
   - Reports invalid .txth files
```

### Backup & Restore
```
1. Create backup:
   - createBackup("backup.zip")
   - Full system state in one file

2. Restore from backup:
   - restoreBackup("backup.zip")
   - Complete state restoration

3. Scheduled backup:
   - createScheduledBackup(backupDir, 7)
   - Keeps last 7 days, removes older
```
